For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the `glm` function to fit a logistic
regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age,
sex and race as predictors.

Save the output of `glm` as an R object; apply the `broom::tidy` to this
object; and obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted
**odds ratio** for solving homicides comparing male victims to female
victims keeping all other variables fixed.

``` r
baltimore_df = homicide_df |>
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore , MD") |>
  select(resolved, victim_age, victim_sex, victim_race) 

fit_logistic =
  baltimore_df |>
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = _, family = binomial())

fit_logistic |>
  broom::tidy() |>
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    ci_low = exp(estimate - std.error),
    ci_high = exp(estimate + std.error)
    ) |>
  select(term, OR, ci_low, ci_high) |>
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale")
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 4
    ##   term              OR ci_low ci_high
    ##   <chr>          <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl>
    ## 1 victim_sexMale 0.426  0.371   0.489

Now run `glm` for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract the
adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing male
victims to female victims. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use
of `purrr::map`, list columns, and unnest as necessary to create a
dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

``` r
or_df =
  homicide_df |>
  select(city_state, resolved, victim_age, victim_sex, victim_race) |>
  nest(resolved_info = -city_state) |>
  mutate(
    test = map(resolved_info, \(df) glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = df, family = binomial())),
    results = map(test, broom::tidy)
  ) |>
  select(city_state, results) |>
  unnest(results) |>
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    ci_low = exp(estimate - std.error),
    ci_high = exp(estimate + std.error)
  ) |>
  select(city_state, term, OR, ci_low, ci_high) |>
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale")
```

Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city.
Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.

``` r
or_df |>
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ci_low, ymax = ci_high)) +
  labs(title = "Estimated OR for solving homicides comparing male to female victims", y = "OR") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 75, hjust = 1)) 
```

![](p8105_hw6_zl3386_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

- From the plot, we can see that in most cities, homicides with male
  victim are significantly less likely to be resolved than those with
  female victim. Among these cities, New York, NY has the smallest OR
  (0.262), which means homicides with male victim have 0.262 times the
  odds of being resolved compared to those with female victim.

- Albuquerque, NM is the only city with an OR significantly larger than
  null value (1), which means homicides with male victim are
  significantly more likely to be resolved than those with female
  victim.

## Problem 2

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2022-01-01",
    date_max = "2022-12-31") |>
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) |>
  select(name, id, everything())
```

We’ll focus on a simple linear regression with `tmax` as the response
with `tmin` and `prcp` as the predictors,

Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produce
estimates of $\hat{r}^2$ and $log (\hat{β}_1 * \hat{β}_2)$.

``` r
# bootstrap function
boot_sample = function(df) {
  
  sample_frac(df, replace = TRUE) 
  # draw a sample with 100% size, with replacement each time
  
}

# draw the 5000 samples
boot_straps =
  tibble(strap_number = 1:5000) |>
  mutate(
    strap_sample = map(strap_number, \(i) boot_sample(weather_df))
  )

# do the `lm` fit
boot_results =
  boot_straps |>
  mutate(
    # map each sample to lm() to get linear models
    models = map(strap_sample, \(df) lm(tmax ~ tmin + prcp, data = df)), 
    glance = map(models, broom::glance),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy),
    r_squared = map(glance, \(df) pull(df, r.squared)),
    log_b1b2 = map(results, \(df) log(abs(df$estimate[2] * df$estimate[3])))
  ) |>
  select(strap_number, r_squared, log_b1b2) |>
  mutate(
    r_squared = as.numeric(r_squared),
    log_b1b2 = as.numeric(log_b1b2)
  )
```

- Since $\hat{β}_1 * \hat{β}_2$ may be non-positive, we use `abs()` to
  take its absolute value and calculate
  $log (| \hat{β}_1 * \hat{β}_2 |)$ instead.

Plot the distribution of the estimates, and describe these in words.

``` r
boot_results |>
  ggplot(aes(x = r_squared)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of r_hat_squared")
```

![](p8105_hw6_zl3386_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
boot_results |>
  ggplot(aes(x = log_b1b2)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of log(b1_hat * b2_hat)")
```

![](p8105_hw6_zl3386_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-2.png)<!-- -->

- The $\hat{r}^2$ distribution is concentrated near 0.92, which means
  the model explains a large proportion of the variance in the response
  variable `tmax`.

- The $\hat{β}_1 * \hat{β}_2$ distribution is concentrated near -5 but
  has a heavy tail extending to low values, which may be related to the
  frequency with which large outliers are included in the bootstrap
  sample..

Using the 5000 bootstrap estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5%
quantiles to provide a 95% confidence interval for $\hat{r}^2$ and
$log (\hat{β}_1 * \hat{β}_2)$.

``` r
r_squared_lower = quantile(pull(boot_results, r_squared), 0.025) |> round(3)
r_squared_upper = quantile(pull(boot_results, r_squared), 0.975) |> round(3)
log_b1b2_lower = quantile(pull(boot_results, log_b1b2), 0.025) |> round(3)
log_b1b2_upper = quantile(pull(boot_results, log_b1b2), 0.975) |> round(3)
```

- The 95% CI for $\hat{r}^2$ is (0.888, 0.94).

- The 95% CI for $log (\hat{β}_1 * \hat{β}_2)$ is (-8.697, -4.601).

my_fit = 
  birthwt_df |>
  lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + smoken, data = _)
```

- We choose `bhead`, `blength` and `smoken` as the predictors, because
  these three have the largest absolute coefficient estimate (`bhead`
  and `blength` positive, `smoken` negative) and smallest p-value (\<
  0.01).

```

![](p8105_hw6_zl3386_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

- We can see that for most of the fitted values, residuals spread
  randomly around zero. However, the residual distribution is skewed and
  has some extremely large outliers at small fitted value (\<1000). This
  may suggest that the model is still missing some important variables.

Compare the model to two others:

- One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
  effects only)

- One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions
  (including the three-way interaction) between these

- From the plot, we can see that the performance of our model (using
  head circumference, length and cigarettes smoked per day, main effects
  only) and the second model (using head circumference, length, sex, and
  all interactions) are similar, while both are significantly better
  than the first model (using length at birth and gestational age, main
  effects only).
