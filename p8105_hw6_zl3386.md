    # a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved
    resolved = case_match(

  # limit to white or black victim_race

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the `glm` function to fit a logistic
regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age,
sex and race as predictors.

Save the output of `glm` as an R object; apply the `broom::tidy` to this
object; and obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted
**odds ratio** for solving homicides comparing male victims to female
victims keeping all other variables fixed.

``` r
baltimore_df = homicide_df |>
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore , MD") |>
  select(resolved, victim_age, victim_sex, victim_race) 

fit_logistic =
  baltimore_df |>
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = _, family = binomial())

fit_logistic |>
  broom::tidy() |>
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    ci_low = exp(estimate - std.error),
    ci_high = exp(estimate + std.error)
    ) |>
  select(term, OR, ci_low, ci_high) |>
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale")
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 4
    ##   term              OR ci_low ci_high
    ##   <chr>          <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl>
    ## 1 victim_sexMale 0.426  0.371   0.489

Now run `glm` for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract the
adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing male
victims to female victims. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use
of `purrr::map`, list columns, and unnest as necessary to create a
dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

``` r
or_df =
  homicide_df |>
  select(city_state, resolved, victim_age, victim_sex, victim_race) |>
  nest(resolved_info = -city_state) |>
  mutate(
    test = map(resolved_info, \(df) glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = df, family = binomial())),
    results = map(test, broom::tidy)
  ) |>
  select(city_state, results) |>
  unnest(results) |>
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    ci_low = exp(estimate - std.error),
    ci_high = exp(estimate + std.error)
  ) |>
  select(city_state, term, OR, ci_low, ci_high) |>
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale")
```

Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city.
Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.

``` r
or_df |>
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ci_low, ymax = ci_high)) +
  labs(title = "Estimated OR for solving homicides comparing male to female victims", y = "OR") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 75, hjust = 1)) 
```

- From the plot, we can see that in most cities, homicides with male
  victim are significantly less likely to be resolved than those with
  female victim. Among these cities, New York, NY has the smallest OR
  (0.262), which means homicides with male victim have 0.262 times the
  odds of being resolved compared to those with female victim.

- Albuquerque, NM is the only city with an OR significantly larger than
  null value (1), which means homicides with male victim are
  significantly more likely to be resolved than those with female
  victim.
