    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    state = toupper(state)
  ) |>
  mutate(
    # create a `city_state` variable
    city_state = paste(city, ",", state),
    # a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved
    solved_status = case_match( 
      disposition,
      "Closed by arrest" ~ 1,
      c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest") ~ 0,
    )

  filter(city_state != "Tulsa , AL") |>
  # limit to white or black victim_race

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the `glm` function to fit a logistic
regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age,
sex and race as predictors.

Save the output of `glm` as an R object; apply the `broom::tidy` to this
object; and obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted
**odds ratio** for solving homicides comparing male victims to female
victims keeping all other variables fixed.

``` r
baltimore_df = homicide_df |>
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore , MD") |>
  select(solved_status, victim_age, victim_sex, victim_race) 
```
